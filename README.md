# PCB_Reflow_plate
This is a redesign of the PCB reflow plate made by AfterEarthLTD. I decided to make the heater and controller detachable and to utilize purely through-hole components to make it more accessable to people who don't have a way to reflow components.

I am not an electrical engineer and i have not tested this out as a prototype yet, so please use this at your own risk.
